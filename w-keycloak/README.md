# wantify-keycloak
The purpose of this repository is to provide an extension to the base JBoss Keycloak Docker image that includes any customizations needed for the Wantify application (e.g. custom themes, custom providers, custom configuration files, etc.).  The gradle script builds and publishes the 'wantify-keycloak' image to our Artifactory repository.
